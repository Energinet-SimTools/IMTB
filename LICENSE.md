# Considerations and terms of use of the IMTB
Energinet provides the IMTB for the purpose of developing an open-source frequency-domain scanning test bench for electrical facility’s model benchmarking or validation and for power system small-signal stability analysis. The tool is developed by power system engineers based on existing knowledge that can be found in literature, with a focus on industrial oriented features and at the time of development, with a non-commercial purpose.

The IMTB is provided and may be used under the following considerations and terms:
1.	Use of the IMTB and its results are indicative and for informational purposes only. Energinet may use it in its own simulation environment to perform conclusive testing, performance and compliance of the simulation models developed and supplied by the facility owner. 
2.	Energinet encourages the other users to use the toolbox if it suits their needs. They are welcome to report issues in IMTB and propose amendments to Energinet.
3.	Use of the IMTB is at the users’ own risk. Energinet is not responsible for any damage to hardware or software, both directly or indirectly, including simulation models or computers, and not responsible for any consequence using the toolbox. 
4.	All intellectual property rights, including copyright to the IMTB remains at Energinet in accordance with applicable Danish law. Energinet does however grant a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-payable right to use, modify and distribute the IMTB as a whole or partly. Energinet may withdraw or modify the right to use, modify and distribute. If Energinet is met with any claim on infringement of third-party intellectual property rights in connection with the user’s use of the IMTB, the user must indemnify Energinet of such claim. 
5.	A user must obtain explicit prior approval from Energinet, in which Energinet may set further terms, if the IMTB is intended to be used:
    -	for further development of the tool (i.e. not only error correction of the existing tool),
    -	in a way which it directly generates revenue for the use of the tool,
    -	as a commercially used tool to compete with other equivalent commercially available solutions,
    - as a non-insignificant part of a tool which holds commercial value.
