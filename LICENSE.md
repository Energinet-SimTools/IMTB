This document describes the immittance measurement toolbox (IMTB) developed by Energinet, including its features, implementation principles and user manual, followed by examples.
Disclaimers:
Energinet provides the IMTB for the purpose of developing an open-source frequency-domain scanning test bench for electrical facility’s model benchmarking or validation and for power system small-signal stability analysis. The tool is developed by power system engineers based on existing knowledge that can be found in literature, with a focus on industrial oriented fea-tures.
The IMTB is provided under the following considerations:
1.	Use of the IMTB and its results are indicative and for informational purposes only. Energinet may use it in its own simulation environment to perform conclusive testing, performance and compliance of the simulation models developed and supplied by the facility owner. 
2.	Energinet encourages the other users to use the toolbox if it suits their needs. They are welcome to report issues in IMTB and propose amendments to Energinet.
3.	Use of the IMTB is at the users’ own risk. Energinet is not responsible for any damage to hardware or software, including simulation models or computers, and not respon-sible for any consequence using the toolbox. 
4.	All intellectual property rights, including copyright to the IMTB remains at Energinet in accordance with applicable Danish law. Energinet does however grant a world-wide, non-exclusive, non-payable right to use, modify and distribute the IMTB as a whole or partly. Energinet may withdraw or modify the right to use, modify and dis-tribute.
5.	Any potential commercial use based on further development of the tool shall contact Energinet and be granted by Energinet.
